1. Landing Page (index.html)

Epic hero with animated gradient background, countdown timer to next exam (editable later), tagline "The Only Study App That Feels Like Cheating (Legally)"

Feature cards with icons, testimonials slider, 50k+ students fake counter

Navbar: Login | Get Started (→ signup) | Dark mode toggle



2. Full Authentication System (edited)

signup.html → Name, Email, Password → NO verification code. Signup completes immediately (show welcome modal / success animation). Do not generate or display a 6-digit code and do not pretend to send an email verification code.

login.html → Email + Password + "Forgot password?"

Password reset is disabled. The "Forgot password?" control should not kick off any reset flow. Instead it should show a clear, friendly modal/toast: "Password reset is currently unavailable in this demo. Please contact support (mailto:gallium.bot@gmail.com) for help." (No reset link, no password emails.)


Persistent login forever (localStorage JWT-style token)

Hamburger menu (after login): Profile picture/initials → Edit Name, Upgrade to Premium (mailto:gallium.bot@gmail.com), Logout, Delete Account

Delete Account flow (edited): When user chooses Delete Account, show a confirmation modal that asks them to enter their email address (the account email) to confirm deletion. On correct match, proceed to delete account and show fireworks-sad animation. (No "type DELETE" step, no verification code required — only the account email input is required to confirm deletion.)
